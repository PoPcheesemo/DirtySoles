The main idea:
A soulsborne game targeted for the 13-30 age group.
The setting is a collection of farms in rural Ireland, each with it's unique theme.
For example a gothic farm with bloodsucking tomatoes and peppers, or a barbaric farm with carnivorous cabbages.

There would be different starting classes for the different farms.

Main weapons would be farming/gardening tools:
Root knives/slayers (Daggers)... Sickles (Curved swords)... Scythes (Great Curved Swords)... Machetes (Short Swords)... Shovels (Long Swords)... 

Two main types of enemies:
GOBLINS: Humanoid little buggers that are souring the soil, causing the veggies to turn bad.
VEGGIES: Plant based monsters.
